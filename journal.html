 So this week we were learning about Pushing. I am having trouble  doing this but I am trying to figure it out. I think that it is good that I now have the formula in my notes app so i will not have to remember the specific instructions every time.

 So today i worked on animations. Originally, my animation would not stay on it and the click would not work. Instead we put all of it in java and changed the animation into an event listener. by putting it all in java instead of just animations, it allowed the click function to work on all of them. I also made all of the divs seperate instead of the same, and then put them in the same class.

I am currently working on rock paper scissors. It is A LOT of conditionals. I wrote out variables for each of the two players and ran math.Random to make two random variables for each of the players. while going through the conditionals, I put a single equals instead of a double equals sign and that confused me for a good amount of time. I then made the conditionals into funcions so it would make the code a bit more consice.One of the functions I had me pass through an argument. this basically works as a placeholder so that i could run player 1 and then player 2 through it without having to do seperate functions for making player 1 and player 2 select which one is rock paper or scissors. I use the argument passing to use the random number produced to create the image for it. I did this by putting "n" in the perentheses when writing the function and then when running the funtion, I put p1 or p2 in the parentheses so it would run n as p1 or p2. I then made a button that ran the game based on the other functions on deciding what image and string it would attach to. In that section, I used a function that I had not used before. called "document.getElementById" that would change the message in a div based on the results of the function.

Today I finished up the first Euler Problem. I already had the functions to solve the actual problem but decided to add to the project by making it so that a number can be taken from the user and then it would take it and add up all the multiples of 3 and 5 below it. I learned how to make an input in html. I then added a button that i learned how to do from rock paper scissors and make it catalyze the function which did the function I knew how to do from the initial go through of it. I added a seperate thing that allowed for on a click a function would occur on the input box that was called "onclick". I made it so that on the click it would take away the previous answer while the person was writing the second number they wanted to test. I used the "getElementById" function again so that i can add in the correct answer to the div i store it in. I also found a problem with my code on the car project which i fixed, the background image for going right was not added in properly which caused the background image not to change when the div was going right.
