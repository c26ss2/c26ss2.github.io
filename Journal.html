 So this week we were learning about Pushing. I am having trouble  doing this but I am trying to figure it out. I think that it is good that I now have the formula in my notes app so i will not have to remember the specific instructions every time.

 So today i worked on animations. Originally, my animation would not stay on it and the click would not work. Instead we put all of it in java and changed the animation into an event listener. by putting it all in java instead of just animations, it allowed the click function to work on all of them. I also made all of the divs seperate instead of the same, and then put them in the same class.

I am currently working on rock paper scissors. It is A LOT of conditionals. I wrote out variables for each of the two players and ran math.Random to make two random variables for each of the players. while going through the conditionals, I put a single equals instead of a double equals sign and that confused me for a good amount of time. I then made the conditionals into funcions so it would make the code a bit more consice.One of the functions I had me pass through an argument. this basically works as a placeholder so that i could run player 1 and then player 2 through it without having to do seperate functions. I did this by putting "n" in the perentheses when writing the function and then when running the funtion, I put p1 or p2 in the parentheses so it would run n as p1 or p2. I then made a button that ran the game based on the other functions on deciding what image and string it would attach to. In that section, I used a function that I had not used before. called "document.getElementById" that would change the message in a div based on the results of the function.
